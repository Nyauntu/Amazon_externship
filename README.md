Amazon Fulfillment Center Externship
Overview

This repository contains the deliverables for my Amazon Operations and People Analytics Externship, a project focused on analyzing operational efficiency and workforce management within Amazon Fulfillment Centers (AFCs). The main objective was to identify key factors driving productivity, burnout, and attrition — and propose data-driven solutions to optimize workflows and improve employee well-being.

Project Objectives

°Understand the operational structure and labor dynamics of Amazon Fulfillment Centers.

°Use data analysis to uncover inefficiencies in workflows and identify potential drivers of burnout.

Recommend actionable solutions for improving retention, morale, and overall productivity.

 Methodology

°The project followed a structured, analytical approach combining data analysis, visualization, and business reasoning.

1. Problem Definition

°High turnover rates and burnout among fulfillment center associates were identified as major operational issues.

°The focus was on analyzing workload balance, employee satisfaction, and task design to locate key bottlenecks.

2. Data Collection & Cleaning

°Collected structured and unstructured datasets from glassdoor reviews and You tube vlogs of past and present Amazon Fulfillment Centre employees (a timeframe of 3 years)
°Cleaned the data for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies using Pandas and NumPy.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

°Used Python libraries such as Natural Language Toolkit and TextBlob to  preprocess the data for sentiment analysis ,visualize patterns in productivity, shift lengths, and order throughput.

°Compared metrics across worker types (full-time vs. part-time) and identified variations linked to fatigue and scheduling intensity.

4. Operational Insights

°Found that repetitive manual tasks and uneven shift distribution significantly contributed to burnout.

°Workload imbalance was a stronger predictor of attrition than total shift hours alone.

°Automation and rotational task design could mitigate stress without compromising speed.

5. Recommendations

°Introduce micro-rest cycles and ergonomic task rotations.

°Reallocate workforce scheduling based on peak load prediction.

°Embed well-being checks and short performance feedback loops within daily operations.

°Pilot a 2-month test to validate impact before full rollout.

Tools & Technologies

°Python – Data cleaning, exploration, and visualization

°Jupyter Notebook – Analysis documentation and reproducibility



Key Findings

Burnout directly affects productivity and retention in high-volume centers.

Employee well-being and workflow efficiency are deeply interconnected.

Redesigning operational culture yields more sustainable results than short-term incentives.
